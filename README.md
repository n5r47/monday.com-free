Google Sheets-Based Work OS - A Creative Take on monday.com

Hi! I'm a content creator with a love for tech, and I've crafted a Google Sheets-based Work OS that's inspired by monday.com but friendly for the bootstrap startup. It's user-friendly, budget-friendly, and just the right kind of techy!

The Gist of This Project
Task Management, Simplified: Manage content and projects with ease. Think monday.com, but in Google Sheets.
Subtasks, Sorted: Advanced logic for subtasks, including ID generation. Organization is key!
Sync Like a Pro: Status synchronization across sheets to keep everything up-to-date.
Time Tracking Made Easy: Start, pause, and stop timers for efficient time management.
Data Management, Automated: Validation, entry, and cleanup scripts to keep data tidy.
Workflow Automation: Enhanced automation for a smooth workflow.
Personalized Functions: User-specific scripts, like setting tasks "On Hold."
Progress Tracking: Tools to monitor completion and archive completed tasks.
Custom Menus: Easy access to functionalities right from Google Sheets.
Setup Guide for Your New Work OS
